## Nirvana
Game made in 48 hours for BC Game Jam 2018 in the themes of "Weird" and "Resolution"! We used Unity to make a game where you could only move through the recoil of shooting and have the goal of the game to find your way to the tree.

Commits are not present because we used Resilo Sync instead of version control and that was a nightmare!
